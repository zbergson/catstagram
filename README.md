This is project is meant to test out Meteor, the so-called Rails for JavaScript. 

To practice my Meteor skills, I made a rough replica of Instagram. It has full CRUD functionality where users can make an account, sign in and create, delete and update posts.

More specifically, users can share posts, like posts that other users have posted (if they're signed in), and visit their individual profile pages. Also, any user can view another user's profile by clicking on their username.
